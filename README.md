Sovol SV06 is a budget printer with compact functions. It adopts the movement structure of polished rod and bearings, thus, no wheels on the printer anymore!
Itâ€™s with an All Metal Hotend and a Planetary Gear Direct Drive Extruder, which supports printing with soft TPU and high-temperature filament, such as PETG, ABS, Carbon Fiber, etc. 
PEI Plate, 25 point Auto Leveling, 32bit Silent Mainboard, Dual Z axis, and Belt Tensioner are all pre-installed on the SV06.

# Source code

This is an unofficial source code for Sovol SV06. The original Marlin source code has been modified to include support for high speed probing. I hold no responsibility if you brick your printer using this source code. And also, I use this source code.
